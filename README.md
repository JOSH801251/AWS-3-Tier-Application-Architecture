# AWS-3-Tier-Application-Architecture
 Description: In this project, a 3-tier architecture was designed and implemented on AWS, including the
 presentation, logic, and data tiers. A VPC was configured with public and private subnets, EC2
 instances were set up with an Application Load Balancer for scalability, and Auto Scaling was deployed
 for dynamic resource management. An RDS instance was managed for database needs, security groups
 and IAM roles were configured, and performance was monitored using CloudWatch.
